## Cloud Certification Study

// Module 1

// Note
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) === server you use to gain access to virtual servers of amazon
Pay as per use

// Note
# Cloud Computing: 
"On demand" delivery of "IT resources" over the internet with "pay-as-you-go" pricing.

Tasks that are repeatitive and time consuming, are the tasks AWS helps you in- Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT

// Note
# 3 Cloud computing deployment models:
Cloud based deployment
On premise deployment (private cloud deployment) : legacy IT infrastructure
Hybrid (some applications on premise, rest functionalities in cloud)

// Note
Benefits of cloud computing
+ Trade upfront expense over variable expense: (You do not have to invest in technology resources before using them)
+ Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
+ Stop guessing capacity: (Accessing services on-demand helps to prevent excess or limited capacity.)
+ Benefit from massive economies of scale
+ Increase speed and agility
+ Go global in minutes: (You can quickly deploy applications to customers and provide them with low latency.)

With EC2, you only pay with running instances, not stopped or terminated ones.
EC2 runs on top of physical host machines managed by AWS using virtualization technology.
When you spin up an EC2 instance, you don't take the entire host, but you are sharing the host with multiple other instances, known as virtual machines.
Hypervisor installed on host machine is repsonsible for sharing the underlying physical resources between the virtual machines. This is called Mutitenacy.

Multitenacy: sharing underlying hardware between virtual machines. 
Hypervisor is responsible for coordinating this multitenacy. Isolating VMs, etc.

EC2 instance allows configuring: type of OS, resources config, software (your or general), database, it will run etc
increase memory and cpu power of existing EC2 instances: vertical scaling
increase EC2 instances in number (no change in config): horizontal scaling

// Note
You control networking aspect of your instace also.
What type of request can come to your server, if they are public or private accessible is decided by us.

// summary
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud provides secure, resizable compute capacity in cloud as amazon EC2.

There are different types of EC2 instances.
Each EC2 instance type is grouped under an instance family & optimized for certain types of task.
(cpu, memory, storage, networking capacity)

EC2 families/instance types: 
1. General purpose 
(good for: web services, code repositories, application server, backend server, gaming server, small/medium db)

2. Compute optimized 
(good for: dedicated gaming Servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modelling, batch processing workloads)

3. Memory optimized (memory intensive workload: "high performance databases")

4. Accelerated computing (good for floating point number calculations, graphic processing, data pattern matching, utilize hardware accelerators, game streaming, application streaming)

5. Storage optimized 
(good for: workloads that require high performance for locally stored data, distributed file system, high frequency online transaction processing (OLTP), data warehousing application, high IOPS reqmnt apps)

# Amazon EC2 purchase options
1. On demand (paying for the amount of time you use it, depending on instance type & OS)
[On Demand: ideal for short-term, irregular workflows that cannot be interrupted. 
Not recommended for workloads that can last for a year or more, better go for reserved instances then.]



2. Savings Plans (low prices of EC2 usage in exchange of "commitment to a consistent amount of usage, measured in $ dollar/hr for 1 or 3 year term") - savings upto "72%" on aws compute usage regardless of  instance family, size, OS, tenancy, or aws region, etc.
-- savings plan: when you make an hourly spend commitment to a instance family & aws region for 1-3 year term.
> Any usage beyond the commitment is charged at regular On-Demand rates.
> savings plan don't include an EC2 capacity reservation option.



3. Reserved Instances (steady state workloads/predictable usage workloads) - offers 75% discount vs on demand pricing. Qualify when you commit to 1 or 3 year term and can pay for them in 3 payment options 
(
    a. upfront (all money in one go in beginning), 
    b. partial upfront, 
    c. no upfront (you don't pay in beginning)
)
-- Reserved instances: you ask for, for your steady state workflow, 1-3 years
# committing early and locking in a minimum level of use with Reserved Instances
[
    Two types:
    A. Standard Reserved instance   (good when you know: EC2 instance type, size, & aws region you plan to run them   [eg. m5.xlarge, microsoft windows server, default tenancy])
    
    B. Convertible Reserved instance (good when you: need to run different instance type, & in different availability zone)
]
> Here you get EC2 capacity reservation: means desired amount of EC2 instances will be available when you need them.



4. Spot instances (allow to use spare amazon EC2 instances for upto 90% off of the on-demand price, but aws can reclaim them anytime it needs giving you a 2 min warning to finish the work & save state, you can resume later. Good for workloads that can tolerate interruption. Example: batch workloads.
> May or may-not be available everytime. )


5. Dedicated hosts (physical hosts dedicated for your use for EC2. These are for meeting certain compliance requirements. Nobody else shares tenancy of that host. )
> Most expensive.
